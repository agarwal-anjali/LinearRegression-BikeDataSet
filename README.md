# Linear Regression Analysis

## About Bike Data Set:
The data contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. 

The data set has 3 files inside, day.csv, hour.csv and Readme.txt. 

## Aim:
To write a short report to propose a linear regression model for the response variable (count of total rental bike daily), investigate if the proposed model is adequate, and propose and fit a new model if needed.

Note: 
- The model is obtained based on the file day.csv only. The information about the columns in this file can be found in Readme.txt. The file hour.csv should be ignored.
- There are many variables in the record, however in this analysis, we consider to use only the following seven
variables/columns: cnt, season, workingday, weathersit, temp, hum, and windspeed.

## Instructions:

- Download the R file.

- Download the data set which is a zipped file named `Bike-Sharing-Datset.zip` and unzip it. 

Note: Do not forget to set the working directory in the `LinearRegressionModel.R` file as the directory in which you downloaded the data set files.

Refer to the `Report.pdf` for further details on the analysis.
